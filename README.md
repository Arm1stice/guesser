Guesser
=======

Guesser is my first C++ project...ever. (So please don't judge too much)

This program generates a random number, and then brute forces a guess until it gets the number correct, and then records the time it takes to do that.

When you open the program, you are asked the maximum random number you want to generate, 
and the amount of trials (How many numbers you want the program to generate) you want to do. 
When all the trials have been completed, it shows a statistic screen that includes the total time taken, 
as well as the average time it took to find the number.

NOTE: This program includes calls to the Windows API, so it is currently Windows only, I am working on a Linux/MacOSX version.
